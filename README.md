This is the new Windows (tested on versions 10 and 11) software to control the EA3CNO DSTAR Modem.
This soft can read/write the firmware version 1.8 but it is a very limited operation, only for use as an emergency terminal.
It works with version 2.0b created in 2024 by me using the original 1.8 version written in PicBasic and a lot of help from EA3CNO (Toni), EA3EXE(Eduard) and EA3IGY(Pep).
